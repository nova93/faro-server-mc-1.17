[19:08:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> test
[19:08:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> hmm interesting
[19:08:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ??
[19:08:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> turning off VPN didnt kick me out
[19:09:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> must setup it's own tunnel
[19:09:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea
[19:16:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> fixed up kelp farm a bit - no hoppers or droppers now
[19:16:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> when you have a minute can I borrow you to check out mob farm? Want to see if any bad sticking points
[19:17:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> sure
[19:17:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> know I will have a few but just any obvious ones
[19:17:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> are you making a mountain?
[19:18:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah that's the plan
[19:18:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its a little big maybe
[19:18:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that;s a fair sized one
[19:18:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> might drop the size a bit
[19:18:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'll be building a stone/cobble generator soon
[19:18:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> iron farm is going in this new hole
[19:18:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I plan to have one but have so much stone atm
[19:19:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> most of these chests full of it
[19:19:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nice hole
[19:19:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> did you clean it up?
[19:19:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:19:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's a bit sus
[19:19:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> how it's all just stone
[19:19:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> did it with mob farm hole too
[19:19:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> no idea why
[19:19:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fairs
[19:19:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> im on discord if you fancy voice
[19:20:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the mob farm, where do you want me to stand?
[19:20:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> i will be heading off in a mo
[19:20:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hmm not sure
[19:20:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> maybe down here?
[19:20:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's the top platforms that would be bad
[19:20:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its a little crazy
[19:20:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> alright
[19:21:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> top levels a little sticky but not too bad
[19:22:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> expected that though - platforms hit side of building
[19:22:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> interesting design
[19:22:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> not going max efficiency tho

[19:29:03] [Server thread/INFO]: davehlewis joined the game
[19:29:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> been watching it work
[19:29:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> seriously cool
[19:29:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how's your ship coming?
[19:29:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how?
[19:29:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> well, "working"
[19:29:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> just flying through, and seeing how it's setup
[19:29:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the ship has the 1st platform now
[19:30:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah?
[19:30:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's not much to look at
[19:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> spiders not too good with the building to climb but rest work
[19:30:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 3-4 more levels before anything is recongnisable
[19:30:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so floor mostly?
[19:30:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea
[19:30:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> is there any redstone in it? can't remember
[19:30:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh yea
[19:31:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nothing crazy
[19:31:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> just some lights and doors
[19:31:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:31:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> what are you using to look at build?
[19:31:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> what you mean?
[19:31:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> are you just going to spectate on this?
[19:31:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea
[19:31:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:32:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> water flow on collection weirdly mesmerising
[19:32:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i don't have any magic 3rd person camera
[19:32:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:32:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> although, it might be possible with Replay mod
[19:32:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> actually it defo is
[19:32:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> turn it on for a few minutes, and then watch the farm working
[19:32:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:32:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that water is so cool
[19:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> minecraft water acts weird, so its nice seeing someone tamed it
[19:32:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:33:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah when putting it in I was so paranoid - is it enough etc.
[19:33:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> works really well though
[19:33:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> aye
[19:33:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> plus it's really cheap as no dispensers etc.
[19:33:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and a simple hopper clock on top
[19:33:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so you can turn it off
[19:33:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah that's one of the main things
[19:34:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i need to finish my mob farm lol, it's been half finished for months now
[19:34:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> why is the bottom level so high?
[19:34:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I spent so long on the hole etc I kept putting off the farm
[19:35:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I wanted platforms inside the building
[19:35:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so planned it on that - build the farm first though
[19:35:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> might put something else down there
[19:35:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> cane or pumpkins or something
[19:35:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> whatever least fits the feudal japanese vibe
[19:36:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> a dungeons
[19:36:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> iron farm will be cool - 4 nodes with 1 pillager to scare them
[19:36:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> for all the indoctrination
[19:36:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:36:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> a completely harmless pillager
[19:36:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> indeed
[19:36:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> amazing how it still scares them
[19:37:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah, plus they have farthest range
[19:37:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ! ravager
[19:37:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you have some snow on the roof
[19:38:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah possibly - I don't mind it

[19:42:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ??
[19:43:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> did something spawn carrying it
[19:43:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> same colour as I used throuighout
[19:43:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> mustve been a piece that got spawned in
[19:43:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that I dropped before
[19:43:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea probably

[20:48:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i've upgraded to Thorns on my armor
[20:48:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think i have just about everything i can on them
[20:48:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> im never a fan of thorns
[20:49:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> for farms etc can cause issues as far as I know
[20:49:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh? i know if you need to afk kill mobs, you need a beacon with health regen due to mobs having a chance of thorns
[20:49:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but wasn't aware it might be an issue for me to have it
[20:49:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I think other things cause issues
[20:49:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> can't remember why tho
[20:50:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> well, we shall see

[21:14:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> can zombit piglin randomly spawn from portal?
[21:14:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea think so
[21:14:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[21:14:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea it surprised me as well
[21:16:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> you in the end?
[21:16:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> aye
[21:16:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah that's why enderman farm rates suck
[21:17:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah sorry
[21:17:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its' ok
[21:17:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ill be out in a few minutes
[21:17:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> doing anything fun?
[21:21:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> just shulkers
[21:21:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[21:21:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> on my way out now
[21:21:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I can tell
[21:28:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oki i think this will do for a week or so
[21:28:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 23 shulkers
[21:28:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[21:29:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> shulker boxes*
[21:29:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> one of the probles of having such a limited storage
[21:29:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> everything is in shulkers
[21:29:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[21:29:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> i'm avoiding that
[21:30:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> shulkers as travelling storage for me
[21:30:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that probably makes a bit more sense than what i'm doing
[21:30:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's such a weird problem
[21:30:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> pretty much everything else in minecraft has THE way of doing
[21:30:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> to get efficiency
[21:31:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[21:31:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you can do whatever, but you know it won't be as efficient
[21:31:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but storage is a weird one
[21:31:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> item storage is always an issue
[21:31:58] [Server thread/INFO]: Villager class_1646['Villager'/96673, l='ServerLevel[faro]', x=1528.85, y=65.70, z=-1715.20] died, message: 'Villager tried to swim in lava'
[21:34:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you can place powder snow in nether
[21:34:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah it's used in shulker farms
[21:35:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i have it my wither skelly design
[22:03:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> jimmy is in successfully!
[22:04:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> jimmy?
[22:04:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> my pillager
[22:04:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah, nice
[22:05:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> just need to build the rest of it...
[22:05:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> from what i remember, it's quite minimalistic
[22:05:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but it does hung in the air
[22:21:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> now I just need villagers
[22:23:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> have a village close by?
[22:23:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> over the sea so not too bad
[22:35:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ship looks great
[22:35:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ty
[22:35:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> mob nightmare right now but guess that sorts itself out?
[22:35:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> eeeeeee
[22:35:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> suuuuuure
[22:35:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hahahah
[22:35:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the ship is not mob proof by design
[22:35:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'll need to do some magic
[22:35:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[22:36:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> where are you?
[22:36:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> main buidling
[22:37:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh
[22:37:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> have you seen my new cape?
[22:37:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh your axcelotls are fixed
[22:38:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah noticed that before - how?
[22:38:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i put the full glass in
[22:38:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[22:38:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> migration to microsoft account
[22:38:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> gives a cape lol
[22:38:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok - I need to do that
[22:38:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's one of the better capes
[22:38:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i've also learned that Axolotls kill some fish
[22:38:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> most look rubbish
[22:38:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ikr
[22:38:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah axolotls kill most things
[22:39:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> like putting a lion fish in an aquarium
[22:39:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lol yea
[22:39:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> have you seen my iron pipe?
[22:39:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> erm...
[22:39:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hope that's not a euphamism
[22:39:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lol
[22:40:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> easier in spectator
[22:40:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> water doesnt look like it's flowing?
[22:40:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, but it is
[22:40:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> weird
[22:41:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ive sketched out the other pipes
[22:41:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I can see
[22:41:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> looks cool
[22:42:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> some of the door redstone?
[22:42:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not sure which circuit that is
[22:42:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but i guess
[22:42:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ooh gunner spot
[22:43:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the biggest pain in the butt in this build is the huge qualtities of coal blocks....
[22:43:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 5.5 stacks already used
[22:43:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I have a bunch
[22:43:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how many do you need?
[22:43:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> about 300 more stacks lol
[22:43:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh...
[22:43:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> lol
[22:43:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea
[22:43:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think i'll build that wither skelly farm
[22:44:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I'd be looking to swap that out for deepslate or something
[22:44:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> will help a lot
[22:44:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha yeah
[22:44:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i have plenty of deepslate, but the silk touched one
[22:44:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah that's the annoying one
[22:44:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, i didn't realise it was worse

[22:44:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> not worse just not as uisable
[22:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> can't become the other variants
[22:45:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea
[22:45:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> backwards to stone
[22:45:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you need to mine them again
[22:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how far you through do you think?
[22:46:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 15%?
[22:46:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh jeez
[22:46:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it gets much harder now
[22:46:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> a lot more materials
[22:46:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but in lower quantities
[22:46:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[22:47:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think i used about 15 shulker boxes of grey concrete for the platform
[22:47:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and about the same of polished andesite
[22:47:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ouch
[22:47:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but it's fine
[22:47:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> one layer at a time
[22:48:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah of course
[22:48:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i have a tnt-powered tree farm on my creative world
[22:48:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh nice
[22:48:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I want to try one of those
[22:48:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the redstone is done, just trying to design a tree trunk around it
[22:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> to make it look semi-ok
[22:48:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hahaha
[22:48:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> know that pain
[22:49:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so many observers in it
[22:49:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but it's my design
[22:49:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> didn't look at any tutorials
