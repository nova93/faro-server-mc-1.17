[17:07:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the ship is starting to look like something
[17:07:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> just on my way to have a look actually
[17:08:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> some of the wood looks weir -its like super industrial then crates
[17:08:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> limitations of mc i gues
[17:08:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yeaaaaaa
[17:08:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> looks awesome though
[17:08:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i was thinking that
[17:09:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the coal makes me wonder if a lot couldn't have been black concrete?
[17:09:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> probably
[17:09:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> adds texture I guess
[17:09:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this is not survival optimised at all
[17:09:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> just hard to get
[17:09:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> especially as so much of the grey is concrete and that is easy to mix up
[17:10:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> then again, i was watching impulse steam the other day
[17:10:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> he also needed a shulker full of coal blocks
[17:10:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[17:10:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and was also struggling lol
[17:10:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> he uses kelp for smelting too
[17:10:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> aye
[17:10:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> his kelp farm is nice - simple but effective
[17:10:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> mine isn't that efficient but is fun
[17:11:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i use lava as fuel
[17:11:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[17:11:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I have like 2 shulkers of lava, could do the same
[17:11:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that's what the small dripstone thing is
[17:11:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> will need to upgrade it to something real at some point
[17:11:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[17:11:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> might move it below
[17:12:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> feed tape
[17:12:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i have a lot of space there now lol
[17:12:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[17:12:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> is that a sorting system?
[17:12:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> two
[17:12:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> one for farm output
[17:12:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the other for mining stuff
[17:13:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the pipes are wild
[17:13:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lol yea
[17:13:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> took forever
[17:13:45] [Server thread/INFO]: Villager class_1646['Villager'/89810, l='ServerLevel[faro]', x=1529.21, y=64.02, z=-1715.85] died, message: 'Villager drowned'
[17:13:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so weird seeing filter redstone not attached to storage direct
[17:14:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> keeps the storage smaller
[17:14:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> you have a slime chunk down here by the looks
[17:14:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but, you can see that i didn't think about overflow, and then just ducttaped it in
[17:14:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea.....
[17:15:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> im wondering what to do down there
[17:15:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'm contemplating two options
[17:15:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I really love the pipes
[17:15:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 1) replace all bedrock level stuff with glass
[17:15:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> feels like a factory
[17:15:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 2) replace all bedrock level stuff with lava, and add a glass floor
[17:15:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah yeah either works
[17:16:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> either way, it's a lot of glass
[17:16:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[17:16:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i am still thinking about adding another pipe
[17:16:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> for slime
[17:16:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I think it's a good idea
[17:16:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but that farm might be just too far for that
[17:17:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how many more layers on the ship?
[17:17:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> about 10 i think
[17:17:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> they are getting complex
[17:17:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[17:18:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> no surprising
[17:18:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'll also need to do some magic with light levels
[17:18:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the whole thing is a mob farm
[17:18:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> no spawn protection?
[17:18:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> none
[17:19:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'll worry about it once it's done
[17:19:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I had that with tree farm
[17:19:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> try to make it match the style
[17:19:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> makes sense
[17:19:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh? ilmango forgot mobs exist?
[17:19:41] [Server thread/WARN]: davehlewis moved too quickly! -13.075708438416996,-8.813296298803124,-7.7763342050727715
[17:20:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i wasn't expecting anything from the ship design, it was made in creative, just for looks
[17:20:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah of course
[17:21:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this one wasn't ilmango - derived from his design
[17:21:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah ok
