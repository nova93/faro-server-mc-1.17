[18:53:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that's an improvement
[18:54:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> im on voice if you wanna chat
[18:54:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> cant atm
[18:54:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but no pressure
[18:54:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> been busy on here though
[18:55:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh?
[18:55:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> come take a look if you like
[18:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> wtf
[18:56:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> busy is one word for it
[18:56:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[18:56:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> might have got a bit carried away
[18:56:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that's awesome!
[18:56:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's easier than I thought it would b
[18:57:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> are you going to do any texturing or just stone?
[18:57:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> not sure
[18:57:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> given my first time I wanted to keep it simple
[18:57:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i feel like with the snow it's good enough
[18:57:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> might be adding more foliage etc. in time
[18:57:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the snow helps a lot to be fair
[18:58:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you can tell it's not generated
[18:58:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it looks too good for that lol
[18:58:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah thanks
[18:58:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> definitely time consuming but got easier as I went
[18:59:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I've tidied down ehre too
[18:59:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah yea
[18:59:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> chests more organised thankfully
[18:59:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you've made 1/3 of a mountain
[18:59:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah about that
[18:59:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i made a design for gold farm
[18:59:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> probably about a quarter
[18:59:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> was going to build it today
[18:59:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah?
[18:59:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i didn't look at any designs
[18:59:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I was going to build a tree farm and lumbar yard next
[19:00:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nice
[19:00:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> running from memory of what I saw of Impulses
[19:00:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nice!
[19:00:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[19:00:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i wanna compare our tree farm designs
[19:00:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh and i got lucky
[19:00:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> Im not sure what design to go with
[19:00:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> lucky?
[19:00:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> look at the floor
[19:01:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i had 1
[19:01:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> now i have 2
[19:01:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> jeez
[19:01:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i hit like 180block/s in rain
[19:01:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> riptide is nuts
[19:01:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:01:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> is this just water source?
[19:02:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:02:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> or is there some arcane reason for it
[19:02:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah you fixed your iron farm!
[19:02:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah all sorted
[19:02:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> what was wrong with it?
[19:02:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it broke again - villagers woke up and couldn't get back to beds
[19:03:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so broke the village part
[19:03:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah right
[19:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> then when I was looking aat the breeder I thought - why don't I do that?
[19:03:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so put the carpet and now they stay in the middle
[19:03:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> noice
[19:03:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> plus I made the bottom bits bigger
[19:03:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> haven't noticed it lol
[19:03:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so no more fences
[19:04:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> any specific reason why you have the whole spawn platform up there?
[19:04:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> rather than just one channel?
[19:04:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> what do you mean?
[19:04:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> on my farms, only the middle is spawnable
[19:04:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the rest is glass
[19:04:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so the iron golems always spawn in the same place
[19:04:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> limits the lava required and stuff
[19:05:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh the 4 is because like this each corner is independent
[19:05:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this is like 4 farms in 11
[19:05:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i mean each platform
[19:05:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> water on it
[19:05:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> they spawn only on stone
[19:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so if they were in the middle each corner would see the golem and resets its counter
[19:06:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh right sorry - didn't really matter I guess
[19:06:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> they just spawn anywhere on the platform
[19:07:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fairs
[19:07:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this looks cooler
[19:07:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'd go for one channel, and one block of lava
[19:07:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> thankfully don't spawn on the mountain
[19:07:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and it would like a waste of space
[19:07:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh lol
[19:07:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea
[19:07:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> measured or accidental?
[19:07:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> bit of both
[19:08:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> zombie died here
[19:08:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> once I measured the first I eyeballe the others
[19:08:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> easier way
[19:09:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> should be mostly ok
[19:12:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oki, back to the grind
[19:12:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:12:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> need to get 2 shulkers of sand lol
[19:12:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> what you working on?
[19:12:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> gold farm
[19:12:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:12:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> exp mode
[19:12:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> where is your desert?
[19:12:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> need a lot of glass for ghast proofing
[19:12:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> north of my base
[19:12:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:13:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not much left of it by now lol

[19:22:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> not needing 5.5 stacks of hoppers for one
