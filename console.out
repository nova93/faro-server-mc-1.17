[17:34:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> o/
[17:35:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> \o
[17:36:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> hows life?
[17:36:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ok I guess - you?
[17:36:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's alright
[17:37:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the job will be slightly different for the next few sprints
[17:37:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah?
[17:37:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it'll likely be working on documentation
[17:37:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> from how to do services, to how to do micro-fronteds
[17:37:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah only the funnest things for you
[17:38:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and mobile teams got an ultimatum lol
[17:38:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh?
[17:38:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> they either manage to rationalise themselves, or they are gone
[17:38:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> finally
[17:38:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> because ExCo doesn't see any point in them
[17:38:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I mean it was their idea to bring them in
[17:38:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> our new CTO is doing some good work
[17:38:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> well it was Al's idea
[17:38:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> "because it looks good to investors"
[17:38:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah well he was a moron
[17:38:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> aka "i want it"
[17:39:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, so that will be interesting
[17:39:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> some cool plans tbf
[17:39:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah sounds good
[17:39:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> one sprint, senior devs are working on how things should look like, and how do we get from now to that
[17:39:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and then the rest of devs are implementing it in one area
[17:40:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so we'll have not just blue prints for how it should work, but also actual migration done
[17:40:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> to reference
[17:40:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but, it does mean 2-3 sprints of writing
[17:40:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that does sound better though
[17:41:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> we are starting with Backend-for-Frontend, which is Apollo Federation and microservices arch
[17:41:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and then Microfrontends
[17:41:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> makes sense
[17:41:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and then working on create-oodle-app (might finally happen, nearly 2 years after Jack started it lol)
[17:41:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> finally
[17:41:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh yea
[17:41:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it makes a lot of sense
[17:42:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'm just not overly enthiusiastic about it
[17:42:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'd rather dev lol
[17:42:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but hey, part of becoming more senior
[17:42:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> gotta start writing more, and dealing with meetings
[17:42:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> definitely one of the worst parts of it for some
[17:43:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I like that side I guess - I can think quickly, but there are lots are far better devs than me
[17:43:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it depends on the job, but i think a senior dev doesn't necessarily have to be an amazing dev
[17:44:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> true
[17:44:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the job is more around enabling others, and getting through to the point
[17:44:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I think so
[17:44:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> there are a few different types I guess
[17:45:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> in other news, i've been messing around with the latest snapshots
[17:45:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> copied this world to local
[17:45:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah? work ok?
[17:45:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not much has changed on the server tbf
[17:45:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[17:45:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> there don't seem to be any new caves below already generated chunks
[17:46:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> apart from water/lava lakes
[17:46:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah I dont think there are on that snapshot
[17:46:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this is the first pass I think just to fill things in with the correct stuff
[17:46:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i was more worried about that one line change, which said user-created buildings could end up buried
[17:47:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh that doesn't sound good
[17:47:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> "Terrain from new chunks will now blend with existing terrain from old chunks. Any player-made structures in these chunks will be either intact, buried, or deteriorated."
[17:47:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[17:47:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but i haven't noticed anything obvious
[17:47:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I assume that is between biomes and things?
[17:47:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> maybe it's not implemented yet
[17:47:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> no clue, that's from the wiki
[17:48:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.18
[17:48:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> "The old bedrock layer between Y=0 and Y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with deepslate." - that did happen on the snapshot
[17:54:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> will be interesting to see if they add any cave generation in
[17:54:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I hope so
[17:55:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> below current chunks?
[17:55:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[17:55:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that'd be interesting
[17:55:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> they'd need to do some checks if user has edited it
[17:55:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah of coures
[17:56:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I mean anything negative y though
[17:56:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> like, i wouldn't like to find a lava lake in my farms lol
[17:56:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so shouldn't be possible
[17:56:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, that'd be nice
[17:56:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oki, i'm off
[17:56:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> heading to B&Q
[17:57:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> got some plumbing to do :-(
[17:57:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> anything fun?
[17:57:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh
[17:57:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not really lol
[17:57:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i'm leaving mc on, gotta farm that gold
[17:57:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> cya
