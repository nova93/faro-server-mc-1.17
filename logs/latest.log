[14:45:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lol sync login
[14:45:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[14:45:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> seems my iron farm has stopped working
[14:45:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> is there a minimum number of villagers or something?
[14:45:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 3 per cell
[14:46:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> looks like I lost a couple
[14:46:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> falling creepers/skellied?
[14:46:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> but other cells should work
[14:46:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> not sure might be skellied
[14:47:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> still not sure why other cells have issues though
[14:48:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so 2 cells on left are only 2
[14:48:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i can see skellies killing them from the mountain frame
[14:48:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but yea, the cells with 3 should be working
[14:49:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> they dont look scared
[14:49:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> they are though
[14:49:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the guys outside the cells, on the bed
[14:49:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> should be running like mad
[14:50:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nowhere to run though
[14:50:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> like the guy im looking at, he doesn't see the pillager
[14:50:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> they do have 2 blocks of the bed
[14:50:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> their head is on a different level as well
[14:50:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> but it was all working before
[14:51:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i wonder if there is a way to see the scared status
[14:51:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> there are mods
[14:52:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I really don't want to have to get the villagers again...
[14:53:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> mind if I spawn 2 in to see if that's the problem?
[14:53:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> go for it
[14:53:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this is really weird
[14:53:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> if it was a different farm I would say being partially loaded breaks it but it shouldn't be a problem
[14:54:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> if that was a problem, us being here would kick it into gear
[14:54:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> we load 12 chunks in each direction
[14:54:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[14:57:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> you seem to be right about them not being scared
[14:58:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh wait i turned it off...
[14:58:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yep def scared
[14:58:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the 1 node is now working
[14:58:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> maybe not enough time to fall asleep?
[14:59:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the ones I spawn new villager into
[14:59:09] [Server thread/INFO]: Villager class_1646['Villager'/7271, l='ServerLevel[faro]', x=-1018.33, y=59.00, z=-1160.54] died, message: 'Villager hit the ground too hard'
[14:59:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> looks like some of them lost their beds or something
[15:00:23] [Server thread/INFO]: Villager class_1646['Villager'/7267, l='ServerLevel[faro]', x=-1026.50, y=62.00, z=-1142.29] died, message: 'Villager was shot by davehlewis'
[15:00:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> right everyone has beds now
[15:01:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its weirdly theraputic hitting them in
[15:01:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> easier with push bow lol
[15:01:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[15:01:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> punch*
[15:02:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> my kelp smelting is finally automated
[15:02:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> done some more work on village too
[15:02:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fuel too?
[15:02:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> not fuel yet, need to build storage building first
[15:03:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nice bridge
[15:03:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this area had some terraforming
[15:03:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea i see
[15:03:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> looking nice
[15:03:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> going to build a little house here. Will do some armour stand work too maybe
[15:03:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh dude, i need to send you the bay download i found
[15:03:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the terraforming there <3
[15:03:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> and my sheep farm has some space for cow farm
[15:03:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ooh nice
[15:04:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> noice
[15:04:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> only a single layer but simple enough
[15:04:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> rebuilt the roof on this one as looked too odd
[15:04:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i need to figure out a nice way to keep them stocked with shears
[15:05:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> adding a hopper to the top makes some wool to get stuck
[15:05:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I have a plan for that with a minecart I turn on and off
[15:05:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[15:05:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea... the wool flies everywhere
[15:05:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> for now I just have it manual
[15:05:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i filled them manually like 2 months ago
[15:05:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I managed to forget of the minecarts - was wondering why wool levels low
[15:05:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and it's running out soon
[15:05:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so manual is good enough really
[15:06:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah it lasts long enough - if this was HC and needed loads I would think about it
[15:06:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that is not an exit!
[15:06:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> sure it is!
[15:06:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ow
[15:07:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its slowly coming together at least
[15:07:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this barrel needs a fishing rod
[15:07:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[15:07:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that's a cool boat design
[15:08:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> thanks, just modified something I found
[15:08:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> going to make a larger version too - again more armour stanfs
[15:08:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so cool
[15:09:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nice
[15:09:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fishing in every game is so dull
[15:09:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> looks very peaceful
[15:10:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but requires so much patience
[15:10:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I ahve a vr fishing gme thats good
[15:10:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i have a fully echanted fishing rod lol

[19:30:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> \o
[19:30:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> o/
[19:30:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> good timiing
[19:30:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh?
[19:30:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> just finished the statue
[19:31:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> omw
[19:31:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> wow
[19:31:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nice one
[19:31:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> whats down there?
[19:32:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> can'[t really claim any credit
[19:32:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nothing
[19:32:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this is much more realistic than I was going for
[19:32:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's so good
[19:32:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> my one more a statue
[19:32:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> on my creative world it looked much smaller
[19:32:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's a good size
[19:33:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the tower/plinth was meant to be taller
[19:33:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> base looks nice too
[19:33:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but, i wasn't about to move the statue higher
[19:33:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> since I built statue yesterday
[19:33:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> could go down with it?
[19:33:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> could do, but it looks alright
[19:33:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:33:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> gotta do some basic terraforming at the back
[19:33:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> his eyes kind of burn into your soul
[19:34:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> uuu i could put a soul flame in them
[19:34:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> please don't...
[19:34:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> hahahahaha
[19:34:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and novamart
[19:34:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i finally got a block swapper working
[19:34:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> had to change the design
[19:34:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:35:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> didn't work
[19:35:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> works perfectly for me
[19:35:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> might be a bit too perfect lol
[19:35:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah needs a little longer
[19:35:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> few ticks
[19:36:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> should be easy to make it longer
[19:36:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's a basic comparator pulse extender
[19:36:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> no idea what goes in here
[19:36:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[19:36:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> was wondering the reason for the room
[19:36:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the reference had it, and i liked it
[19:36:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's like an office or something?
[19:36:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not a clue
[19:36:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the reference was only the outside
[19:36:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[19:37:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how spawn proof is statue?
[19:37:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fully
[19:38:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> well this is awkward
[19:38:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lol
[19:39:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think the next project will be a gold farm
[19:39:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah?
[19:39:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> maybe
[19:39:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> idk
[19:39:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I'm not sure what to work on next. Maybe mountain
[19:40:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ouch, that's gonna be a lot of work
[19:40:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:40:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> might do it in chunks
[19:40:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> mhmm
[19:40:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> just doing a normal looking mountaint too
[19:40:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nothing special
[19:41:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that was close
[19:42:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> uuuu just over
[19:42:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:42:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> didnt realise could go so high
[19:42:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> had to adjust my fall a bit
[19:42:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nearly ended up on mountain
[19:42:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> eek
[19:42:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> thought i was safe
[19:42:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> there was a bit of panic
[19:42:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lol
[19:43:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> right, back to projects
