[19:06:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> o/
[19:07:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> \o
[19:07:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> my kelp farm is mostly done
[19:07:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> very nice
[19:07:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the farm part anyway. Need to add the processing part
[19:07:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> my slime farm is working
[19:08:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ooh nice
[19:08:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> thats one of my next things
[19:08:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> or rather, it was working before you logged in :-P
[19:08:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> whoops
[19:09:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> finally realised the benefit of smokers
[19:09:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> man that kelp is flying through
[19:09:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you use kelp to power kelp smoking?
[19:10:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:43:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> where'd you go?
[19:43:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> imma hidden
[19:43:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> want to see it in action?
[19:44:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> noice
[19:44:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> why the signs?
[19:44:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nothing too much
[19:44:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it looks nicer with them
[19:44:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> signs allow the water to flow on top
[19:44:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> will only flow 1 block otherwise
[19:44:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you can do that with slabs
[19:44:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but this works and looks ncier
[19:44:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah this was for looks too
[19:45:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this will be my smoker area
[19:45:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> part of the villiage town thing
[19:45:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> did you try litematica?
[19:45:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> litematica?
[19:45:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> a schematic mod
[19:46:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah no, I'm making this up as I go
[19:46:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> allows you to build things in creative, and then have a shopping list and an overlay
[19:46:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> when I get to other stuff maybe
