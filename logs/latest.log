[18:46:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> how are you doing?
[18:46:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> was afk at the tree farm
[18:46:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> im alright
[18:46:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> im on discord if you wanna chat
[18:46:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah I just finished my tree farm
[18:47:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> cant chat right now - bedtime for girls
[18:47:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fairs
[18:47:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i got myself a standing desk today
[18:47:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh nice
[18:47:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so damn heavy lol
[18:47:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's still in boxes
[18:47:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha yeah mine is crazy
[18:48:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> do you have a floor mat?
[18:48:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[18:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> well a standing matt thing yeah
[18:48:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> with some padding for your feet?
[18:48:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[18:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> anti fatigue matt I think it's called
[18:49:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> would you recommend?
[18:49:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its good for longer periods yeah
[18:49:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I only got a cheapish one. Duronic
[18:49:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> im planning on starting with 30mins standing, 30mins sitting
[18:49:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> good plan
[18:49:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> see how it goes
[18:49:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> should only do that really
[18:50:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> doesn't need loads of standing
[18:50:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, standing for too long is also bad
[18:50:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> most recommended is 45 then 15
[18:51:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> terrified to turn this farm on
[18:51:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> hahahahahaa
[18:51:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> lemme see
[18:52:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> what is that portal just to the north of your main one?
[18:52:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> squid farm
[18:53:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> where is the tree farm?
[18:53:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> in village under wood workshop
[18:54:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's crazy
[18:54:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah that's how it keeps the tnt in line
[18:54:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> clever
[18:54:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah very simple
[18:55:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I got litematica working
[18:55:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oooooo clever double piston extension
[18:55:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's a really nice design
[18:55:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> very nice
[18:55:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> all tree types?
[18:56:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> looks like all tree types
[18:56:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> all but dark oak
[18:56:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 5x5 is the biggest empty space needed
[18:56:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, of course
[18:56:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> jungle won't give enough samplings most likely
[18:56:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> lets turn it on I guess
[18:57:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i have it on a pressure plate
[18:57:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's on as long as i stand there
[18:57:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> noice
[18:57:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> well this part seems fine
[18:57:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> tnt duper scares me
[18:58:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> why 2 sets of pistons in the feed tape?
[18:58:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> eee tree is out of the water now
[18:58:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I think the acacia can go a bit wonky
[18:59:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this doesn't look right to me lol
[18:59:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hmm tnt duper not going off
[19:00:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> is it meant to detect block updates through scaffolding?
[19:01:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> can you turn it off and on so I can see?
[19:01:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ty
[19:02:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hmm seems to activate then deactivate up here
[19:02:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> what state do you want it in?
[19:02:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> on?
[19:02:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I think off for now
[19:02:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's off
[19:03:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> thanks
[19:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that's the state of the plans and things are showing as wrong
[19:03:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> they were right before though
[19:03:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> pressing I should show you the difference
[19:05:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this is on when it shouldn't be
[19:05:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> thats odd
[19:06:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> missing torch
[19:06:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> might have been it
[19:07:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> eeee
[19:07:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> take 2
[19:07:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> your piston feed tape is a bit broken
[19:07:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> here
[19:07:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh
[19:07:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hmm
[19:08:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's because it was blowing uo
[19:08:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it reached 12 at the 2nd extension
[19:08:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and then broke here
[19:08:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i was playing on a copy of this world in creative yesterday
[19:08:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> doing some flying machine tnt dupers
[19:09:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so scary
[19:09:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you kick it off, and you just hope it works
[19:09:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I bet
[19:09:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> at least in the nether, where i want to use them, the worst that can happen is they'll blow themselves up
[19:09:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nothing of any importance there, not yet anyway
[19:10:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think i'll add a bonemeal generation module to my tree farm
[19:10:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> right I think that's it
[19:10:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the damn thing goes through 3 shulkers in no time
[19:11:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:11:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> :crossed-fingers:
[19:11:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> tnt inc
[19:11:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> hot damn
[19:12:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> looks perfect
[19:12:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i like that throwing tnt design
[19:12:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> might steal that for the nether perimeter project
[19:12:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> easier than doing it manually
[19:12:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> its ilmangos
[19:13:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> try something different
[19:13:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> birch or spruce
[19:13:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this is damn near perfect
[19:13:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> slight loss, since some blocks fall on the wood
[19:13:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and then blow up
[19:13:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> feed tape broken again
[19:13:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but meh
[19:13:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah yea
[19:13:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I could add more to the delay between tnt
[19:13:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it's just a hopper clock
[19:13:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> wouldn't help
[19:14:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> since the blocks are on the wood, they'll stay there until the wood is broken
[19:14:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah yeah
[19:14:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> so what is happening with this feed tape?
[19:14:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> one is quicker than the other
[19:14:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> the delays are right for the design
[19:15:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> server lag?
[19:15:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> could be
[19:15:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I could just shove blocks next to it so it won't push them out
[19:15:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> some furnaces yea
[19:15:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> pretty basic but would work
[19:15:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> interesting that it's getting there at all
[19:16:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i would have though it would be a single width
[19:16:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> oh, it's a double piston extender
[19:16:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that's why
[19:16:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that seems overly complicated
[19:16:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i mean, the 1st push of the tree
[19:16:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> is double
[19:17:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> or rather, potentially double
[19:18:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> what is you leave this second column be?
[19:18:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the 1st piston should push it all no?
[19:18:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> huh?
[19:18:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this one
[19:18:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it should be fine to push everything
[19:18:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> acacia again
[19:18:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> because of the growth pattern
[19:19:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> hmmmmmm
[19:20:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> furnaces in place
[19:22:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> its working perfectly now
[19:22:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not a hitch
[19:22:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nice
[19:22:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> another wood then
[19:24:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think it'd drop tnt slower
[19:25:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> only like 3-4 blocks get destroyed per tnt
[19:25:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> love hopper clocks for this sort of thing
[19:25:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ikr
[19:25:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> will bump it a little
[19:26:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> right last challenge - acacia
[19:28:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's working
[19:28:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nice
[19:29:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> nice!
[19:29:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I'm so happy
[19:29:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> well done
[19:29:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this will make my village creation easier
[19:29:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> biggest thing for me it litematica working too
[19:29:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> using fabric I shouldn't have the problems getting optifine to work either
[19:30:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> missing cactus?
[19:30:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah just while testing
[19:30:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> for optifine, you need optifine and optifabric
[19:30:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I have that
[19:30:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> phew another farm off the list
[19:30:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> back to some build
[19:31:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and im back to my tree farm lol
[19:31:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:31:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> need like 80 stacks more
[19:31:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I need to finish the sawmill now
[19:31:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> jeez
[19:31:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> what wood?
[19:31:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> anywood
[19:31:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh ok
[19:31:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> to turn into coal
[19:31:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and then coal blocks
[19:31:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 9 stacks of wood = 1 stack of coal blocks
[19:32:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you sure?
[19:32:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:32:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I have the farm now
[19:32:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> merci
[19:32:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> also nowhere near all of my wood - had loads before the farm
[19:32:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> we need to start thinking about dec and 1.18
[19:32:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:33:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it adds new layers to this world
[19:33:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> will have to clear out below farms etc.
[19:33:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> yea, and the smoothing is also nice
[19:34:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> more below, more above
[19:34:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:34:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i might be able to build that massive statue
[19:34:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:34:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 230 blocks tall that thing is
[19:34:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> insane
[19:34:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> haha
[19:34:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> thankfully, it's mostly stone
[19:34:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and a few ores here and there
[19:35:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> should be easy enough to gather mats
[19:35:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> will be a crater with a statue in to fit
[19:35:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> :-D
[19:36:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i was thinking about making a crater for it
[19:36:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> line it with something very expensive
[19:36:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but at the scale, the walls would be cliffs
[19:36:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so yea, an interesting problem
[19:36:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[19:37:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> my farm looks crude now lol
[19:37:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this isn't mine remember
[19:37:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> tru, but you did built it here on the server
[19:39:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> right I'm off. Going to have a try at some CSS battle stuff to see how I do
[19:39:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> enjoy!
