[15:36:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ive made a small change
[15:36:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> which made it safer
[15:36:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh?
[15:36:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> for some reason, they are attracted to the conduit
[15:36:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> so i moved it outside and low
[15:37:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> during the night, and most of the time during the day, none of them are on the surface
[15:37:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah yeah the cogregated
[15:37:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> oh yeah all down that end

[16:01:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> woo!
[16:01:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that damned stone
[16:02:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> did you patch up that one hole in the floor?
[16:02:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[16:02:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> it annoyed me
[16:03:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> beautiful
[16:03:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> this is the 3rd monument i see empty
[16:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 2 of them were done solo
[16:03:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah
[16:03:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> damn, such a good moment
[16:03:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not on this server, in total minecraft career
[16:03:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I guessed
[16:04:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> theres our starting point
[16:06:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> marked the middle - what will be the funnelled to area
[16:06:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> nice
[16:06:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> gonna need a poop load of glass now
[16:06:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> need to build the tanks
[16:06:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> we do have like 10 shulkers of sand lol
[16:06:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> true
[16:07:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> just need to decide colour scheme
[16:07:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> up to you
[16:07:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> iskall went with black stone and light blue glass
[16:07:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> which is ok
[16:08:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> we could go prismarine and clear or white glass
[16:08:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> keep in theme
[16:08:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> black stone contrasts though
[16:08:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> my original idea here, was to open this side up
[16:08:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> where the original entry was
[16:08:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and have a portal in a tunnel
[16:08:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> underwater
[16:08:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah cool
[16:09:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> killing chamber has to be lower down though
[16:09:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and you'd walk in directly into the farm
[16:09:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> we can send them higher
[16:09:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> but yea
[16:09:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> how tall does the fall need to be for auto?
[16:09:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> if we go for iskall design it doesn't ship them around much
[16:09:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> 23 or something
[16:09:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 23 is for zombies/skellies
[16:09:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's like 40 for ender
[16:10:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[16:10:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it's like 5+their hp
[16:10:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> make a retractable floor for manual too
[16:10:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> do we need manual?
[16:10:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I want an xp farm closer
[16:10:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> mhmm
[16:10:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> fairs
[16:11:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> is it closer than end farm?
[16:11:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> if that's ok
[16:11:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah
[16:11:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> as far as I'm concerned, you are in charge of this project, if you want the job :-)
[16:11:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> well its more a straight line
[16:11:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ok
[16:11:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> will go finish my slime farm for a few levels and come back
[16:12:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ill put a couple shulkers into the furnaces
[16:12:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> whats your next plan?
[16:12:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> no idea
[16:13:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i think it's back to the grind, need to finish that ship
[16:13:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah yeah
