[17:42:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> o/
[17:43:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> right, i have a simple design for a dripstone farm
[17:43:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> now, to get some to kick it off
[17:43:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I have made a super basic one
[17:44:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> it grows so slooooooooooow
[17:44:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> which has yielded none so far
[17:44:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> i remember the pointe dripstone i set up by the starter base
[17:44:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> took like 5 days for it grow lol
[17:52:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> the biggest blobl of dripstone i found was 8 blocks...
[17:52:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> that stuff is nearly as rare as diamonds lol
[17:58:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> sorry was designing something
[17:59:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> crazy - should be caves of it
[17:59:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> not yet i think
[18:02:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> I still thought there was a good amount at certain levels
[18:02:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> no idea, but i think i have enough to kick it off
[18:02:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> 12x12 area
[18:06:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> what am i doing with shulker boxes.... i had 64 a week ago, i have 2 now
[18:07:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> ah, the ship needed like 30 for decoration
[18:07:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and the bbig dig took the rest

[18:21:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> this is nuts
[18:21:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> you start it by standing on the pressure plate
[18:21:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> yeah I did that by accidenty
[18:21:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> every time you fill a bucket, you get a new one
[18:22:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> that was close
[18:22:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> and that sorter there
[18:22:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> will be a sorter with stackable droppers
[18:22:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <davehlewis> ah ok
[18:22:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> into a water way to those tunnels
[18:22:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <sykst> trying my best to limit amount of hoppers
